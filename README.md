The following steps represent the troubleshooting methods when assessing a technical issue.

<details>
<summary>
  
### Step 1: Identify the Problem
</summary>

**Gather Comprehensive Information:** Collect detailed information about the problem, including error messages, system logs, and user reports. Utilize tools like event viewers or log analyzers to get a clearer picture.

**Isolate the Scope:** Determine whether the issue is localized to a specific user, device, or a broader system-wide problem. Narrowing down the scope helps in focusing troubleshooting efforts.

**Check for Recent Changes:** Investigate recent software or hardware changes, updates, or configurations that might have triggered the issue. This includes updates to drivers, applications, or system settings.

### Step 2: Establish a Theory
</summary> 

**Hypothesis Formulation:** Based on the collected data, formulate one or more hypotheses about the root cause of the problem. Consider different angles and potential causes.

**Prioritize Theories:** Prioritize theories by likelihood and impact. Focus on theories that are most probable and have the greatest impact on system functionality.

**Consult Knowledge Base:** Review relevant documentation, knowledge base articles, and past troubleshooting experiences to gather insights into potential solutions.

### Step 3: Test the Theory
</summary>

**Isolate Variables:** Conduct tests in controlled environments to isolate variables. This helps confirm or eliminate specific theories without affecting the overall system.

**Use Diagnostic Tools:** Employ diagnostic tools, scripts, or utilities to gather more data and evidence to support or refute the theories. This might involve network analyzers, system performance monitoring, or hardware diagnostics.

**Monitor in Real-Time:** Set up real-time monitoring to observe the system behavior while implementing changes. Monitor logs and metrics to track progress and any new issues that may arise.

### Step 4: Establish a Plan of Action
</summary>

**Identify Corrective Actions:** Based on the confirmed theories, outline specific corrective actions required. This could involve modifying configurations, applying patches, or replacing hardware components.

**Consider Rollback Options:** Before implementing changes, plan for potential rollbacks in case the corrective actions have unintended consequences or do not resolve the issue.

**Define a Timeline:** Establish a timeline for implementing the plan of action, considering potential downtime and impact on users. Communicate this timeline to stakeholders.

### Step 5: Implement the Plan
</summary>

**Execute Changes Methodically:** Implement the planned actions methodically, following best practices and change management procedures. Avoid making multiple changes simultaneously to ensure clarity in cause-and-effect relationships.

**Verify Configuration Changes:** Double-check that all configuration changes are correctly applied and that there are no syntax errors or typos in configuration files or commands.

**Document Changes:** Keep a detailed record of all changes made during this step, including what was modified, when, and by whom. This documentation will be valuable for future reference.

### Step 6: Verify Full System Functionality
</summary>  

**Functional Testing:** Conduct comprehensive functional tests to confirm that the issue has been resolved and that the system behaves as expected. This may involve user acceptance testing (UAT) or automated test scripts.

**Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor system performance during and after the resolution to ensure that the changes haven't introduced new performance bottlenecks or issues.

**User Feedback:** Collect feedback from end-users to validate that the problem no longer exists and that their workflows are functioning correctly.

<summary>
  
### Step 7: Document Findings
</summary>

**Create a Detailed Report:** Document the entire troubleshooting process, including steps taken in each phase, theories tested, actions implemented, and their outcomes. Include any relevant logs, screenshots, or performance data.

**Root Cause Analysis:** If a root cause was identified, provide a detailed analysis of what caused the issue and how it was resolved. This helps prevent similar problems in the future.

**Lessons Learned:** Summarize key takeaways from the troubleshooting experience, highlighting what worked well and what could be improved in future troubleshooting efforts.
